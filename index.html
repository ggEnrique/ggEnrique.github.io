                <h2 id="heading-about">About</h2>
                <p>I am a former English teacher and technology advocate, now enthusiastically transitioning towards a
                    career in the tech industry. As an Apple Certified
                    Teacher, I've always explored innovative methods to engage my students using technology. Besides my
                    experience with Apple apps, I've also gained familiarity with various Google apps and have imparted
                    this knowledge to my students.</p>

                <p>Recently, I have completed a series of online courses, including web development ones where I've
                    acquired foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Alongside this, I have also learned
                    Python and Technical Support Fundamentals. This has deepened my understanding of how different
                    technologies can interplay to create user-friendly applications.</p>

                <p>Presently, my attention is concentrated on honing my front-end skills through more advanced courses,
                    with a roadmap to learn React and Node.js in the near future. My relentless passion for learning and
                    progressing in this field has driven me to actively seek internships or bootcamps that offer
                    immersive, hands-on experience with these technologies. I am particularly excited about
                    opportunities that allow me to collaborate on real-world projects with other developers and apply my
                    technical support skills to solve complex problems.</p>
