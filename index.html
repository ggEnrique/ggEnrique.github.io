                <p>
                    I am a former English teacher and technology advocate looking to pursue a career in the
                    the tech industry. As an Apple Certified Teacher, I always sought out innovative ways to engage my
                    students using technology. In addition to my experience with Apple apps, I also have knowledge of
                    various Google apps and taught my students how to use them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Recently, I completed several online courses, including web development courses where I learned
                    basic
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I learned Python and Technical Support Fundamentals, which
                    has
                    given me a deeper understanding of how different technologies can work together to create
                    user-friendly
                    applications.
                </p>

                Currently, I am focused on advancing my front-end skills by taking more advanced courses, and I plan to
                learn React and Node.js in the future. My passion for learning and growth in this field has me actively
                seeking internships or bootcamps that offer hands-on experience with these technologies. I am
                particularly interested in opportunities to collaborate on real-world projects with other developers.
